A developer portfolio website provides relevant information to potential employers about your skills, experience, and projects you've worked on.

You can consider your portfolio website to be your online résumé.
 Potential clients and hiring managers can easily find you online and check out your previous projects and skills.

This also means that when anyone wants to give you an opportunity to work for them, and they ask for your previous projects, you just give them one link to your website (your portfolio). It not only has your projects but your skillset and information about your past experience as well.
You can make a cool portfolio website for yourself with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. And that’s what we are going to do here.

I already did this some months ago and made it available to everyone as a free product on GitHub, so I decided to create a tutorial on how I got it done.
A portfolio website is a unique way to showcase your work and let others know about yourself. It's like an evergreen platform for your projects, case studies, and information about you. In addition, it's one of the best ways to express your personality, experience, and capabilities.
